# Visualization shifts in political preferences
### Joos Akkerman (11304723) - MPROG Project 2019 (Summer), Minor Programming, University of Amsterdam

This visualizations aims to give insight in the shifts in political preferences in the Netherlands, in the period 1946-2017. It uses data from national elections (Tweede Kamerverkiezingen) and pairs this with left-right scores for the large parties in each period to represent the shift in the average political preference.

The [opening page](https://jakkerman.github.io/MPROG_Project/index.html) gives an explanation of the visualization and the way the scores are computed:

The [visualization](https://jakkerman.github.io/MPROG_Project/visualization.html) consists of three components:
* The map, showing in color which rile (the left-right score) each municipality had in the 2017 election. ![alt text](https://github.com/JAkkerman/MPROG_Project/blob/master/Img/screen1.JPG)
* The rile chart, showing the development of the rile for the selected region in a particular region. Selecting new regions draws the lines on this graph, which allows for the user to compare regions to each other.

* Detailed information on the election results of the selected region. This is shown in a line chart, which shows development over the years,
and a pie chart, which shows the data per year in a more detailed manner.

Lastly, a [case study](https://jakkerman.github.io/MPROG_Project/casestudy.html) for one of the parties, which shows that the used data is explanatory for the general developments in the Dutch political landscape.
