#Problem Statement#
Current-day politics may be the most tumultuous since the Second World War. Major parties
who have governed the Netherlands for half a century are now in decay and other parties
are coming up. This development is highly influential to the politics of the Netherlands,
which is why I want to create a data visualization that gives more insight in the electoral
shifts for different regions in the Netherlands

#Solution#
My data visualization will try to show the electoral shifts in Dutch politics.
I will show electoral data per municipality, province, and the whole country for multiple
(general) elections, which will show electoral shifts by comparing different years.
This visualization will allow anyone who is interested in the electoral developments
to check these developments for their region of choice.
