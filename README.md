### Joos Akkerman (11304723) - MPROG Project 2019 (Summer), Minor Programming, University of Amsterdam

This visualizations aims to give insight in the shifts in political preferences in the Netherlands, in the period 1946-2017. It uses data from national elections (Tweede Kamerverkiezingen) and pairs this with left-right scores for the large parties in each period to represent the shift in the average political preference.

The opening page gives an explanation of the visualization and the way the scores are computed:
