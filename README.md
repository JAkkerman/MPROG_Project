# Visualization shifts in political preferences
### Joos Akkerman (11304723) - MPROG Project 2019 (Summer), Minor Programming, University of Amsterdam

This visualizations aims to give insight in the shifts in political preferences in the Netherlands, in the period 1946-2017. It uses data from national elections (Tweede Kamerverkiezingen) and pairs this with left-right scores for the large parties in each period to represent the shift in the average political preference.

The opening page gives an explanation of the visualization and the way the scores are computed:

The visualization consists of three components:
* The map, showing in color which rile (the left-right score) each municipality had in the 2017 election. ![alt text](https://github.com/JAkkerman/MPROG_Project/blob/master/Img/screen1.JPG)
* The rile chart, showing the development of the rile for the selected region in a particular region. Selecting new regions draws the lines on this graph, which allows for the user to compare regions to each other. ![alt text](https://github.com/JAkkerman/MPROG_Project/blob/master/Img/screen2.JPG)
* Detailed information on the election results of the selected region. This is shown in a line chart, which shows development over the years,
and a pie chart, which shows the data per year in a more detailed manner. ![alt text](https://github.com/JAkkerman/MPROG_Project/blob/master/Img/screen3.JPG)
